# Running Deltamod from source
## Script
We have a custom script that you can run to install dependencies. Use `Run.cmd` or `Run-Linux.sh` to run the program. If it doesn't find an installation of Node or GM3P, it will prompt the user to download them.
## Manual (not reccomended)
If the script doesn't work, follow these steps:
- Download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
- Download the latest GM3P version for your system from [here](https://gamebanana.com/tools/20063) and extract it to the `gm3p` folder. If it doesn't exist, create the folder.
- Now you can open your preferred command prompt and run `npm test` to run Deltamod.

### Note: Linux support halted
In its current state, Deltamod is very buggy on Linux devices. This is partly to blame on Deltamod being mainly engineered around Windows. You can build and run Deltamod on Linux from source, but **no support will be provided from devs in case of bugs.**
